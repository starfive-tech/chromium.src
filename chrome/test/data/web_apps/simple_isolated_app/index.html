  <h1>Isolated App w/o Service Worker</h1>
  Service worker is no longer required for installation of isolated app.

  This site is intended to be served at the root of a server to allow
  isolation. Thus the scope of the serviceworker and resources is at the root,
  and not in the sub directory here.
