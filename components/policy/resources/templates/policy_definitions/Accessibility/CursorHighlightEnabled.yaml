  Enable the cursor highlight accessibility feature.

            This feature is responsible for highlighting the area that surrounds the mouse cursor while moving it.

            If this policy is set to enabled, the cursor highlight will always be enabled.

            If this policy is set to disabled, the cursor highlight will always be disabled.

            If you set this policy, users cannot change or override it.

            If this policy is left unset, the cursor highlight is disabled initially but can be enabled by the user anytime.
