  Enable the mono audio accessibility feature.

            This feature is responsible for outputing stereo audio which includes different left and right channels, so different ears get different sounds.

            If this policy is set to enabled, the mono audio will always be enabled.

            If this policy is set to disabled, the mono audio will always be disabled.

            If you set this policy, users cannot change or override it.

            If this policy is left unset, the mono audio is disabled initially but can be enabled by the user anytime.
