caption: Override First-Party Sets.
default: {}
desc: |-
  This policy provides a way to override the list of sets the browser uses for First-Party Sets features.

        Each set in the browser's list of First-Party Sets must meet the requirements of a First-Party Set.
        A First-Party Set must contain an owner site and one or more member sites.
        A set can also contain a list of service sites that it owns, as well as a map from a site to all of its ccTLD variants.
        See https: //github.com/WICG/first-party-sets for more information on First-Party Sets are used by <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>.

        All sites in a First-Party Set must be a registrable domain served over HTTPS. Each site in a First-Party Set must also be unique,
        meaning a site cannot be listed more than once in a First-Party Set.

        When this policy is given an empty dictionary, the browser uses the public list of First-Party Sets.

        For all sites in a First-Party Set from the <ph name="REPLACEMENTS">replacements</ph> list, if a site is also present
        on a First-Party Set in the browser's list, then that site will be removed from the browser's First-Party Set.
        After this, the policy's First-Party Set will be added to the browser's list of First-Party Sets.

        For all sites in a First-Party Set from the <ph name="ADDITIONS">additions</ph> list, if a site is also present
        on a First-Party Set in the browser's list, then the browser's First-Party Set will be updated so that the
        new First-Party Set can be added to the browser's list. After the browser's list has been updated,
        the policy's First-Party Set will be added to the browser's list of First-Party Sets.

        The browser's list of First-Party Sets requires that for all sites in its list, no site is in
        more than one set. This is also required for both the <ph name="REPLACEMENTS">replacements</ph> list
        and the <ph name="ADDITIONS">additions</ph> list. Similarly, a site cannot be in both the
        <ph name="REPLACEMENTS">replacements</ph> list and the <ph name="ADDITIONS">additions</ph> list.

        Wildcards (*) are not supported as a policy value, nor within any First-Party Set in these lists.

        All sets provided by to policy must be valid First-Party Sets, if they aren't then an
        appropriate error will be outputted.

        This policy is available only on Windows instances that are joined to a <ph name="MS_AD_NAME">Microsoft® Active Directory®</ph> domain or Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise instances that are enrolled for device management, and macOS instances that are managed via MDM or joined to a domain via MCX.
