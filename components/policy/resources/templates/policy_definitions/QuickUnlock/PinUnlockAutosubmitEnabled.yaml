caption: Enable PIN auto-submit feature on the lock and login screen.
default_for_enterprise_users: false
desc: |-
  The PIN auto-submit feature changes how PINs are entered in ChromeOS.
            Instead of showing the same textfield that is used for password input, this
            feature shows a special UI that clearly shows to the user how many
            digits are necessary for their PIN. As a consequence, the user's PIN length
            will be stored outside the user encrypted data. Only supports PINs that are
            between 6 and 12 digits long.

            If this policy is set to false, users will not have the option of enabling
            the feature on the Settings page.
