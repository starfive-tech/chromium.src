caption: Enable users to set weak PINs for the lock screen PIN
desc: |-
  Setting the policy to Enabled allows weak PINs. Some characteristics of weak PINs: only one digit (1111), digits increase by 1 (1234), digits decrease by 1 (4321), and common PINs. Setting the policy to Disabled means users can't set weak, easy-to-guess PINs.

        By default, users get a warning, not an error, for a weak PIN.
