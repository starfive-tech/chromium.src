Description:
This directory contains a copy of the Polymer framework and some elements from
the Polymer elements catalog (https://elements.polymer-project.org/). See
v3_0/package.json for a full list of components.

The source git repositories can be found at:
https://github.com/Polymer/polymer

Polymer is comprised of two efforts:
1. A set of core platform features (Shadow DOM, Custom Elements, MDV).
Initially, these core features will be enabled with a set of polyfills. As
browsers begin to implement these new primitives, the polyfill platform layer
becomes smaller and better over time.
2. A next-generation web application framework built upon these core
technologies called the Polymer.

Local Modifications:
- Applied modifications that can be found in v3_0/chromium.patch.
- All inline JavaScript blocks are extracted from Polymer HTML elements to
external JS files. This version of the Polymer is used in a web UI, where CSP
forbids an execution of inline scripts. The extraction was made with the help of
the Crisper tool (https://github.com/PolymerLabs/crisper).
- Removed executable bit from some files.
- Resolved encoding issues.
- Replaced CRLF line endings with LF line endings in text files.
- Removed files that are not needed by Chromium, see v3_0/rsync_exclude.txt.
- Re-implemented <paper-ripple> using Web Animations API (which, as of
  2/21/2017 does not work in Safari or IE). This is a complete fork from
  Polymer's <paper-ripple>.
- Removed CSS properties that are not needed in Chromium using
  css_strip_prefixes.py script.
- Bundled and minified Polymer 3 with minify_polymer.py, since Polymer 3 repo
  does not distribute minified files.
- Note that the Polymer 3 bundle does not include dir-mixin.js which is
  responsible for polyfylling :dir() CSS rules, because it causes a performance
  regression (and it is unnecessary), see crbug.com/899603 for more context.

./v3_0/reproduce.sh on a Linux machine.
